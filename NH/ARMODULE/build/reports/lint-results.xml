        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the `android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES` javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"

        explanation="This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with the `minSdkVersion` attribute).&#xA;&#xA;This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute. However, if the attribute is important to the appearance of functionality of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer attribute.&#xA;&#xA;Note: This check does not only apply to attributes.

        explanation="The &lt;application> tag should appear after the elements which declare which version you need, which features you need, which libraries you need, and so on. In the past there have been subtle bugs (such as themes not getting applied correctly) when the `&lt;application>` tag appears before some of these other elements, so it&apos;s best to order your manifest in the logical dependency order."
